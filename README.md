# ixD Documentation example for designers

available via [https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/)

Corporations with engineering background maintain a huge structure to share and contribute code. Designers are able to use that very structure to create their own solution for communicating a project.

This repository is based on Jekyll, maintaining a fake app which is called "framer meetup munich agenda app" - a very boring title but again, a fake app - made to serve as an example.

## How to use

Using this repository as template or [idratherbewriting](https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/documentation-theme-jekyll) (another far more advanced template) as an example requires basic jekyll skills and interest in [writing markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you aren't enjoying Jekyll, take a look at [my list of documentation solutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Pv5R7PUbzoQm3y5n6bMCyR3-5SzqoUOQqh8QOApy3U/edit?usp=drive_web) and how well they play with embedded content.

1. Create a folder where you like to run your documentation (could be in your GitHub folder)
2. Learn how to install [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) on your computer (requires a terminal).
3. Download this repository.
4. Copy this repository in the folder you just installed jekyll.
5. Run Jekyll (maybe delete bundlefiles for troubleshooting)
6. Open your localhost in your browser

### Workflow

Be aware this workflow is not suitable for complete beginners but manageble. Mentorship is highly recommended.

With Jekyll and writing markdown you are able to edit your documentation and receive a folder filled with static html files. These files can be hosted by a webserver, send zipped in a mail, printed as PDF, stored on a usb stick or commited via git. Github as platform runs jekyll natively on their servers and turns Jekyll files into a hosted public repository (if requested).

This solution is higly accepted in secure environments without any cloud solution available.

[Why and how](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/) documentation can be written is available as article and structured in  chapters such as:

* [Project objective](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/#find-your-project-objective)
* [Breaking down your project](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/#breaking-down-your-project)
* [Learn about your users](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/#learn-more-about-the-user)
* [Writing features](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/#writing-for-features)
* [Embedding prototypes](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/#embedding-screens-and-prototypes)
