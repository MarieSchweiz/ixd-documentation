Documentation is an underestimated discipline in almost every company. Allthough we know documentation is able to help a team, projects and companies in many ways. Yet we seem to ignore its power and keep postboning it to the very last moment. The "Framer Munich Meetup Agenda App" is an example of how to do documentation first and how documentation can:

* Minimize Meetings
* faster onboarding individuals
* discover product touchpoints
* empower general communication
* Help making educated decisions
* Prevent repeated knowledge sharing

Bottom line: Documentation can help you saving a lot of time. For engineers its a neccessarity, for designers it isn't yet. Documentation made me a better designer. It takes bravery and guts to admit you know almost nothing about your project in the beginning. Your documentation will reflect that, bold and visible to you and others.  

## Get started

Find a platform. Which software or cloud solution is able to provide that is [collected in a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Pv5R7PUbzoQm3y5n6bMCyR3-5SzqoUOQqh8QOApy3U/edit#gid=0) If you know a suitable candidate, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Start writing
Take a pen and some paper, grab your colleagues and figure out why you are there and why someone is giving you money to do this. A [design sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/) is helpful for kickstarting your project. Spicing up your sketching skills can good too.

### A Project objective

Writing down an objective of your project can be very helpful. It helps you to keep focus and it takes a great to designer to figure that out. Also keeps you from thinking about how you would use this product. An Objective should be:

* Understandable
* Fullfill a user need
* As long as needed and as short as possible

### Breaking down your project

A product contains usually a couple of features and patterns connecting them. It helps to figure out how big your product will be and which elements are global and which one are just connected to certain features. The hirachy helps you to setup a list of files you like to write. A little app like Framer Munich Agenda App does not need several documents while bigger projects have one for each feature or Pattern.

A navigation bar is a pattern.

A login form is a feature with several scenarios.


### Learn more about the user

What users like to archive, their goals and so on. Talk to them observe them and anchor this observation to the top. It will help to fight against the unconsious mindset this product is designed for you. 

Add: 
* Jobstories & Personas 
* Userjourney
* Or Flows

### Testing and documentation

One of the most powerful parts in documentation are embedded test results. Instead of collecting test results and through them over the fence, embedd them into your documentation and link it. This documentation has a [changelog](changelog/) which is handy for testresults. A test documentation contains:

* Test setup and testscript for the interviwer
* Scope of this testing
* Question you had and their answers
* Your conclusions
* Your notes while you have tested
* New questions for the next tests
