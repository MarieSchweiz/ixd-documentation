Documentation is an underestimated discipline in almost every company. Allthough we know documentation is able to help a team, projects and companies in many ways. Yet we seem to ignore its power and keep postboning it to the very last moment. The "Framer Munich Meetup Agenda App" is an example of how to do documentation first and how documentation can:

* Minimize Meetings
* faster onboarding individuals
* discover product touchpoints
* empower general communication
* Help making educated decisions
* Prevent repeated knowledge sharing

Bottom line: Documentation can help you to save a lot of time. For engineers its a neccessarity, for designers it isn't yet. I'd like to share why documentation made me a better designer. It takes bravery and guts to admit you know almost nothing about your project in the beginning. Your documentation will reflect that, bold and visible to you and others. (Agencie's don't feel comfortable about that. It doesn't fit to their selling or marketing mindset)


## How to start a design documentation
take a pen, grab your colleagues and figure out why you are there and why someone is giving you money to do this.

### 1. The Objective

I'd like to recommend writing down an objective of your project. It helps you to keep being focused and it takes a great to designer to figure that out (depending on the client).
