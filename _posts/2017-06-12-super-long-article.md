The First release for the Framer Meetup Munich App prototype will happen on [June 14th in Berlin at a Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/berlin-lean-prototyping/events/239280149/). Marie Schweiz will speak about its existance and [why and how](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/why/) we do documentation first.

## Testing opportunities

The prototype has a few testing opportunities. 

* Meetup information could be too boring or schedule information not clear enough. 
* Missing beginning time in the title could be very confusing
* Voice button doesn't appear enough as a button which has to be pressed

Marie will use a chance and talk on June 14th to attendees about that and document her findings here.

Findings will be linked to improvements.
