The First release for the Framer Meetup munich App prototype will happen on June 14th in Berlin at a Meetup. Marie Schweiz will speak about its existance and why we do documentation first.

## Testing opportunities

The prototype has a few testing opportunities. Meetup information could be too boring or schedule information not clear enough. Marie will use a chance and talk on June 14th to attendees about that and document her findings here.

Findings will be linked to improvements.

## Found something?

You can aways reach Marie via [Mail](mailto:marie.schweiz@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ma_rylou) and share your thought about this project.
