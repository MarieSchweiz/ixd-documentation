Today we are testing with Katie, Brian and Orban. All testers never seen the app before and are based in Munich.

* Katie is a visual designer and never heared of framer before, she is using adobe after effects.
* Brian is a visual designer, his colleague is using framer
* Orban is a Ui developer and using framer already

## Testsetup

All three characters are fictional, the test too - usually i'm saying how we have testet and what

* framer meetup info
* framer speech recognition
* framer meetup schedule

CONNECTED PROTOTYPE GOES HERE

## Findings 

### 1. [Framer meetup information](https://marieschweiz.github.io/ixd-documentation/#meetup-information)

**Conclusion:** Asking about how good the button is we have learned it is okay because the screen is very empty and nothing else to tap on. None of our testers tried to tap the title.

* Readability and contrast wasn't an issue...and so on
* Users loved the pulse animation and didn't felt stressed
* Users read the title and did not missed any information (e.g. begin)

open questions: we don't know about dropouts, is blue a likeble color? is the sky green...

Maybe drop your interview script about this screen here
