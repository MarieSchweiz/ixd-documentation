* Brian is a visual designer, his colleague is using framer
* Orban is a Ui developer and using framer already

## Testsetup

All three characters are fictional, the test too - usually i'm saying how we have testet and what

**Conclusion:** Asking about how good the button is we have learned it is okay because the screen is very empty and nothing else to tap on. None of our testers tried to tap the title.

* Readability and contrast wasn't an issue...and so on
* Users loved the pulse animation and didn't felt stressed

open questions: we don't know about dropouts, is blue a likeble color? is the sky green...

Maybe drop your interview part about this screen here
