# What is "Framer MUC Agenda App" ?
Objective: Giving registered attendees of [Framer Munich Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/meetup-group-framerjs-munich/) a sneek peak on what is happening. Let unrigerested designers know how amazing interaction design can be. Serve as example on how to documentate interaction design.

## MVP definition
With the first Prototype, we like to cover the most important information for attendees. Future editions can help to understand the topic we are talking about, allow them to archive and collect them for learning purposes and 

* What (Framer Meetup Munich)
* When (June 26th)
* Where (at Google Germany)
* What is happening (Schedule)
* Who is speaking
* Which workshops are available
* What should every attendee bring

In Version 2, additional information could be useful:

* Hashtag usage ( e.g. #FramerMUC )
* Speaker information
* Sponsor information

### Target group and User analysis
Munich based designer with or without coding background. Interested in interaction design and product documentation.
Pain & Gain

#### Exemplary Userjourney


### Components

# Main concept
With only 3 views, all informations should be wrapped and served interactive. Information is structured by importance so users have no trouble to get everything about the meetup with just two or three tabs. 

1. First priority is **What, When and where**, so users are able to figure out their availability. 

2. Feature transition is charging users emotionally to make them exited about the upcoming meetup. (Feature transitions can highlight a meetup topic or sponsor)

3. Schedule overview with information for workshops (requirements)

4. How to catch up with attendees and where to find the next meetup or workshop

## What When and Where
Objective: Inform the potential about What is happening (A meetup about framer) when (June 26th) and where (at google munich)
